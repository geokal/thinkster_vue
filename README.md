Welcome to exercise 1

1. Create a new component in the components folder. Give it any name you would like, but sure to use the .vue extension

2. Create a template, script, and style block within your component.

3. Within the root div, create a paragraph with your name.

4. Create a block within the script tag to export the component, giving it a name. This will be used to identify the component when importing it.

5. Clear out the links in the HelloWorld.vue component to clean things up.
